ðŸš€ Day 16 of #100DaysOfCode 
Part A | Python | AI Coach John
Today, I explored the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs).
Before diving into classes and objects, I first practiced writing normal functions for a simple use case:
Logging in a user
Viewing data
Submitting assignments (Student role)
Assigning assignments (Teacher role)
This helped me understand the difference between functional programming and OOPs, and why OOP makes code more organized, reusable, and scalable.
Key takeaway:
Starting with simple functions builds a strong foundation before moving into OOP concepts like classes, objects, and methods.
Excited to rewrite the same logic tomorrow using OOP principles!
Thankyou AI Coach John sir! 




# Today iam going to learn the oops ; 
#1st iam going to do the normal function and than do the oops based methods!

def login(user_date) :
    print(f"{user_data["name"]} has logged in today")
    
def view(user_data):
    print(f"{user_data["name"]} has viewed the Data")
    
def submit(user_data) :
    if user_data["role"] == "Student" :
        print(f"{user_data["name"]} has submit the assignment")
    else:
        print("Teachers do not want to submit the assignment")
        
def assigned(user_data) :
    if user_data["role"] == "Teacher" :
        print(f"{user_data["name"]} has assigned the assignment")
    else:
        print("Student do not want to assign the assignment")

#user_data= {"name" : "Veera", "role" : "Student"}
user_data= {"name" : "Pandi", "role" : "Teacher"}

login(user_data)
view(user_data)
submit(user_data)
assigned(user_data)
