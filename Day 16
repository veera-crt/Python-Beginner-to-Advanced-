ðŸš€ Day 16 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode
After taking a short break from OOP, Iâ€™m back on track and continuing my journey! ðŸ’»âœ¨
I was stuck for almost a week because of OOP concepts â€” but that challenge really opened my eyes to how much deeper I need to go in coding. ðŸ”‘
Today, I worked on building a simple math operations module in Python:
ðŸ”¹ Created functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication & division
ðŸ”¹ Imported and used these functions in a separate main.py file
ðŸ”¹ Tested them successfully (results showing up in the terminal âœ…)
It feels great to see things running smoothly â€” and I must thank my AI Coach John, for guiding me through these concepts and keeping me consistent. ðŸ™Œ
Learning never stops, and every small step counts towards becoming a better developer. ðŸ’¡

main.py

import pandas_math as pdm
s=pdm.multiply(9,9)
print(s)
m=pdm.divide(72,2)
print(m)

pandas_math.py

def addition(a,b):
    return a+b

def subtraction(a,b):
    return a-b

def multiply(x,y):
    return x*y

def divide(x,y):
    return x/y

try now! 

thankyou ai coach john
